**Important Considerations**

- **Credentials:** Imported workflows may reference credentials that are not present in your n8n instance. Ensure you have the necessary credentials set up, or update the workflow to use existing ones.
- **Workflow IDs:** When importing via the CLI, be aware that workflow IDs from the JSON file may be retained or reassigned, depending on your database setup. For consistent behavior, it's advisable to let n8n assign new IDs upon import. citeturn0search1
